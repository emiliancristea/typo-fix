# üõ°Ô∏è TypoFix Download Security Guide

## üö® Important Notice

When downloading `TypoFix.exe`, you **will** encounter security warnings from your browser and Windows. This is **completely normal** and **expected** for unsigned executable files.

---

## üîç Understanding the Warnings

### Why Browsers Show Warnings

Modern browsers flag **any unsigned executable file** as potentially dangerous, including legitimate software like TypoFix. This happens because:

1. **No Digital Signature**: TypoFix is not signed with a code signing certificate
2. **Browser Security**: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox protect users from potential malware
3. **Download Frequency**: Less commonly downloaded files trigger warnings
4. **File Type**: All `.exe` files without signatures are flagged

### This Does NOT Mean TypoFix is Dangerous

- ‚úÖ **Open Source**: All code is publicly available for inspection
- ‚úÖ **Community Verified**: Growing user base with positive feedback
- ‚úÖ **Minimal Permissions**: No admin rights or system modifications required
- ‚úÖ **Transparent Operation**: Clear documentation of all functionality
- ‚úÖ **No Data Collection**: No telemetry, logging, or user tracking

### Additional Verification Steps

## ‚ùì Why Not Get a Code Signing Certificate?

### Cost Barrier
- **Annual Cost**: $200-$400 per year

- **Extended Validation**: More expensive option ($400-800/year)

### Open Source Reality
- **Free Software**: TypoFix is completely free to use
- **Community Project**: No commercial backing for certificate costs
- **Trusted Alternative**: Open source code provides transparency

### Future Considerations

- Certificate donation programs
